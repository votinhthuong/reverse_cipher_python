print('Input your message to encrypt: ') #Ask user input their plain text
message = input() #the string they input will be stored in variable called "message"
encrypted = '' #create variable to store decrypted string
i = len(message) - 1 #because index start from 0, "len" function count from 1 so we have to minus for 1
while i >= 0: #Reaching to the first index from last index of string
    encrypted = encrypted + message[i] #Store in "encrypted" variable the result we need
    i = i - 1 #decrease "i" variable so that we can reverse all character in string
print('Your secret text: ' + encrypted) #And we output the result to sreen for user! Ta-da
